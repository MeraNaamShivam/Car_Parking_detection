This project is a web application that detects and counts free and occupied parking spaces in a video feed. It uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify whether a parking space is occupied by a car or not. The application is built using Flask, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras.
